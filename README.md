# Vue-Typed-Routes âœ¨

TypeScript 4.9 adds the `satifies`-Operator to the Typing System. This enables us to combine `as const` (for the specific type of an expression) and `satisfies` (to make the expression also match some type) to create new typings with a very specific base type. 

We can now use this combination to create a better typing for the vue router. Suppose we have the following routes defined:

```ts
const routes = [
  {
    path: "/",
    name: "Home",
    component: HomeView,
  },
  {
    name: "About",
    path: "/about",
    // route level code-splitting
    // this generates a separate chunk (About.[hash].js) for this route
    // which is lazy-loaded when the route is visited.
    component: HomeView,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/test",
        name: "test",
        component: HomeView,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: "Login",
    path: "/login",
    component: HomeView,
  },
]
```
We can now add `as const` aswell as `satifies` to make the routes match our predefined type `ReadonlyRouteRecordRaw`
```ts
...
  {
    name: "Login",
    path: "/login",
    component: HomeView,
  },
] as const satisfies readonly ReadonlyRouteRecordRaw[];
```
With that in place we can now try to make the router routes typesafe.

### 1.Approach: Extract all route names and add custom composable
```ts
type RouteNames = ExtractRotuteNames<typeof router> // "Home" | "About" | "Login"

export function useTypedRouter() {
	const router = useRouter();

	return router as Omit<Router, 'push'> & {
		push: (
			to: ExtractRouteNames<typeof routes> | Exclude<RouteLocationRaw, string>
		) => Promise<NavigationFailure | void | undefined>;
	};
}

// Use composable
const Header = defineComponent({
	setup() {
		const router = useTypedRouter();

		router.push('Home');
	},
});

```

### 2.Approach: Create type for routes-object and create an object based on the type 
```ts
const APP_ROUTES: ExtractRoutePaths<typeof routes> = {
	HOME: '/',
	ABOUT: { ROOT: '/about', TEST: '/test' },
	LOGIN: '/login',
};


// Later somewhere in the app:
router.push({ path: APP_ROUTES.HOME }}
```

### Handling Params
When using Approach 2, we check if the path is a dynamic route => if so, expect a function that takes the param and returns the full path
```ts
// Extends the routes from above
... 
children: [
			{
				path: '/test',
				name: 'test',
				component: HomeView,
			},
			{
				path: '/:testId',
				name: 'TestDetails',
				component: HomeView,
			},
		],
...

const APP_ROUTES: ExtractRoutePathsWithParams<typeof routes> = {
	HOME: '/',
	ABOUT: {
		ROOT: '/about',
		TEST: '/test',
		TESTDETAILS: (test) => {
			return `/test/${test}`;
		},
	},
	LOGIN: '/login',
};
```


### Last note: The routes const need to be casted to Readonly<RouteRecordRaw[]>, otherwise the router won't accept it
```ts
export const router = createRouter({
	history: createWebHistory(import.meta.env.BASE_URL),
	routes: routes as Readonly<RouteRecordRaw[]>,
	...
	
```
